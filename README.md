Hello EveryOne...
This is a Student Report Card Management System Project done using C programming.
The concepts Used here are : File Handling,Structures,Functions,Pointers and Arrays.
This project works absolutely fine with DEV C++ Compiler.
And Also works good with OnlineGDB But line number 170 and 173 are commented they have to be uncommented to run the code successfully.
The file used here is student.dat file to store all the student details. And a temp.dat file used as a temporary file.
